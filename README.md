This is a XeLaTeX template for invoices that confirm the export services. [Original template (.doc)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h03kvzcq8u9vcp7/Invoice_direct_final.doc?dl=0), taken from [here](https://dou.ua/forums/topic/14378/); similar ones were published by several banks with a few differences, examples: [1](https://b2b.pumb.ua/content/cmsfile/ua/%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B8%20%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F%20%D0%B2%D1%96%D0%B4%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%82%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%85%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%83__%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B2-%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0.pdf), [2](https://my.ukrsibbank.com/common/upload/invoys_eksport.doc).

Just copy the example and replace question marks with your data. Some optional fields are commented by default; their absence is gracefully handled, with no hanging commas or so. You may use some predefined constants, see the source for details.
